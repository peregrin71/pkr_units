# Security Policy

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately via GitHub Security Advisories: https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/security/advisories/new

Do NOT open a public issue for sensitive security reports.

What to include in your report

- Affected versions
- A short summary of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (minimal reproducer if possible)
- Proof-of-concept or exploit details if available
- Any suggested remediation or patches

Acknowledgement and triage

- We aim to acknowledge new reports within **7 business days**.
- Reports will be triaged on a case-by-case basis.

Fixing and disclosure

- The project prefers to **embargo disclosure** until a fix is ready and coordinated with the reporter.
- By default, maintainers will prepare and publish fixes; security fixes are **maintainers-only** to ensure coordinated disclosure.
- We will not publish a reporter's name or identifying details without their explicit consent.

Coordination details

- We do not require PGP-encrypted submissions; send details via the GitHub Security Advisory interface.
- We do not automatically request CVE identifiers for all issues; this can be discussed on a per-issue basis.

Automated scanning

- The project runs automated scanning (for example CodeQL/SCA) and will monitor findings as part of routine maintenance.

If you need a private email contact for urgent or sensitive reports, contact the maintainers and we will add a private contact channel (this file will be updated accordingly).
