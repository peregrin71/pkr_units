# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct v2.1 to set expectations for participant behavior. Please read it to understand what is expected of all contributors and maintainers.

The full text is maintained at: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Derogatory comments or slurs
- Repeatedly disruptive behavior
- Publishing private information without consent

## Enforcement

Maintainers are responsible for the enforcement of this Code of Conduct. When a report is submitted, maintainers will review it and may take actions including a private warning, temporary suspension, or a permanent ban from project spaces depending on the severity and frequency of the behavior.

## Reporting

To report a code of conduct violation, use GitHub's report-abuse flow: https://support.github.com/contact/report-abuse. This is the recommended channel for private or sensitive reports.

For non-sensitive concerns you may also open a regular issue titled "Code of Conduct report"; maintainers will treat such reports seriously but note that issues are public and not suitable for private complaints.

If you are a maintainer and need a private, out-of-band contact configured for your project (for example an email address for sensitive reports), add that contact information to `SECURITY.md` and update this document accordingly.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces including repository issues and pull requests, mailing lists, IRC/Discord/Matrix channels, and in-person events sponsored by the community.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1 (https://www.contributor-covenant.org).
